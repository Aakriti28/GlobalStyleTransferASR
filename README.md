## GlobalStyleTransferASR
Problem statement
  - Prosody plays an important role in characterizing the style of a speaker or an emotion, but most non-parallel voice or emotion style transfer algorithms   do not convert any prosody information.
  - Two major components of prosody are pitch and rhythm.
  - AutoPST disentangle global prosody style from speech without relying on any text transcriptions.
 

Here we have experimented with Rhythm Style Transfer (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08519.pdf) for the following cases:-
- Fast speaker to slow speaker
- Slow speaker to fast speaker
- Abnormal speech pattern
